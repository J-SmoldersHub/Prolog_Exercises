5.5 Exercises
Exercise  5.1 How does Prolog respond to the following queries?

X  =  3*4.				        same, X = 3 * 4 - it is instantiated
X  is  3*4.				        X = 12
4  is  X.				        Error, cause X is not instantiated here to compare
X  =  Y.				        same, X = Y - it is instantiated
3  is  1+2.				        true
3  is  +(1,2).				    true
3  is  X+2.				        Error, cause X is not instantiated here to compare
X  is  1+2.				        X = 3
1+2  is  1+2.				    false, you should use = or =:=
is(X,+(1,2)).				    X = 3
3+2  =  +(3,2).				    true
*(7,5)  =  7*5.				    true
*(7,+(3,2))  =  7*(3+2).        true
*(7,(3+2))  =  7*(3+2).		    true
7*3+2  =  *(7,+(3,2)).	        false
*(7,(3+2))  =  7*(+(3,2)).	    true

Exercise  5.2

Define a 2-place predicate increment that holds only when its second argument is an integer one larger than its first argument.
For example, increment(4,5) should hold, but increment(4,6) should not.

isOneHigher(X,Y) :- Y is X + 1.

Define a 3-place predicate sum that holds only when its third argument is the sum of the first two arguments.
For example, sum(4,5,9) should hold, but sum(4,6,12) should not.

isSumOf(X, Y, Z) :- Z is X + Y.

Exercise  5.3 Write a predicate addone/2 whose first argument is a list of integers,
and whose second argument is the list of integers obtained by adding 1 to each integer in the first list. For example, the query

   ?-  addone([1,2,7,2],X).

should give

   X  =  [2,3,8,3].

addOneToList([],[]).
addOneToList([H1|T1], [H2|T2]) :-
  H2 is H1 + 1,
  addone(T1,T2).
